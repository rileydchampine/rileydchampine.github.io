    	<h3>20 Years of MLS Cup Playoffs</h3>
    	<a href="MLSPlayoffGrid.svg" target="_blank"><img src="MLSgrid_screenshot.png" alt="MLS Cup Playoffs" style=max-width:20%;height:auto; align="left"></a>
    	<p>I constructed a visual history of the MLS Cup Playoffs during their most edition at the close of the league's 20th season. I used this side project to experiment with Illustrator's capabillity to produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics" target="_blank">SVG</a>s with pixel perfect clarity. I am quite happy with the result. This graphic not only shows how teams have succeeded and failed in the playoffs over time but also reveals how the league has adapted to new teams joining. In some years, the degree of difficulty in making the playoffs has been eased by the number of open spots in each conference. There is some welcome symmetry in finally having an even 20 teams in the league's 20th year.</p>

       	<h3>The Forum</h3>
       	<a href="The_FORUM_Sumbission.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="forumcover3-05.jpg" alt="The Forum" style=max-width:20%;height:auto; align="left"></a>
       	<p>To coincide with the 100th year anniversary of the University of Oregon's school of Architecture &amp; Allied Arts, the college announced it would hold a competition to gather ideas about what a new AA&amp;A building ought to look and feel like. I teamed up with a pair of architects and together we envisioned "The Forum" — a collaborative hub for all majors that caters to the needs of students working together on group projects. We conducted a survey about where UO students work together and identified critical components that create a space that is conducive for collaboration. I designed this <a href="https://rdcportfolio.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/theforum.pdf" target="_blank">infographic</a>to communicate our findings and provide evidence for what student's care about when it comes to group projects. "The Forum" ultimately finished second in the competition.</p>

       	<p>During the Winter of 2014/15, I participated in the <a title="Colligan User Interface Design Challenge" href="http://colliganchallenge.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">Colligan User Interface Design Challenge</a> put on by the University of Oregon Office for Research, Innovation and Graduate Education. After assembling a team of five undergraduates from a variety of majors we conceived Chromaptic — a location-based gaming app that aims to facilitate the shift of everyday personal transportation from the automobile to healthier modes of travel, such as biking, walking and running.<a href="https://rdcportfolio.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/chromapticpitch.pdf" target="_blank">Our design proposal</a>, was selected as one of four finalists out of a field of 20 teams and ended up taking place 3rd place in the contest overall.</p>

       	<h3>Diversity in the College of Arts and Science</h3>
       	<a href="http://infographics.uoregon.edu/projects/cas-diversity/" target="_blank"><img src="cas_logo.jpg" alt="CAS Diversity" style=width:10%;height:auto; align="left"></a>
       		<p>In preparation for an important conference held by the University of Oregon <a href="http://inclusion.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">Division of Equity and Inclusion</a>, the interim dean of the <a href="https://cas.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">College of Arts &amp; Sciences</a> called upon the InfoGraphics Lab to design a poster that explored ethnic and gender diversity in the college. For my contribution to the poster, I created a <a href="https://rdcportfolio.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/cas_elements_piece.pdf" target="_blank">periodic table of majors</a> to portray how diversity varies between different programs and has evolved over time. The design reflects the motto of the College of Arts and Sciences: "It's Elemental", and utilizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple">small multiples</a> to display detailed patterns with repetition.</p>

       	<h3>The McLoughlin Bikeway: A Safe Route to School Through the Heart of West Medford</h3>
        <a href="McLoughlinBikeway.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="maps" src="mcloughlincoverphoto.jpg" alt="McLoughlin Bikeway" style=width:15%;height:auto; align="left"></a>
       	<p>As a bike commuter, improving active transportation in the United States is an important personal goal. For my final group project in Bike Transportation Planning, three other students and I explored options for developing a <a href="http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/" target="_blank">Safe Route to School</a> in Medford, OR. After a site visit and a lengthy GIS analysis that incorporated census data and the city's road network, we drafted a plan to create the McLoughlin Bikeway. This hypothetical corridor aims to provide a critical connection between existing bike facilities and establishing a safe passage for elementary and middle school riders. Our group produced a 20 page report and a full size poster to display our findings to local government leaders and stakeholders in Medford.</p>
