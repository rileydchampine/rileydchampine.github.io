       		<p>You've found the website of an aspiring cartographer, spatialist analyst, and graphic designer – <em>i.e., a map geek on the job hunt.</em></p>
		<p>I recently graduated from University of Oregon with a B.S. in <strong><a href="http://geography.uoregon.edu/">Geography </a></strong>and a minor in <strong><a href="https://pppm.uoregon.edu/">Planning, Public Policy &amp; Management</a></strong>. My focuses are Geographic Information Science, cartography, and active transportation advocacy. Right now, I work in Sillicon Valley as a GIS Tech for a big tech company. In the past, I've worked on an ><strong><a href="http://migrationinitiative.org/content/atlas-wildlife-migration">atlas about ungulates in Wyoming</a></strong>, helped maintain a geodatabase of over <strong><a href="http://map.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">80 buildings and 20,000 rooms</a></strong>.</p>
