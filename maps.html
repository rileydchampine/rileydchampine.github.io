       	<h1>Mapping Major League Soccer</h1>
       		<p>I designed the "North American Soccer Experiment: A Cartographic Visualization of Major League Soccer in 2014" for the culminating project of my Advanced Cartography Course (GEOG 495). With the guidance of my Professor, James Meacham, I submitted this map to National Geographic's Student mapping competition and ultimately won first place. The design process allowed me to combine three of my most prominent obsessions: soccer, data visualization, and cartography. It was an incredible honor to receive recognition from The National Geographic Society and the Association of American Geographers as a result of my work.</p>
