       	<h3>Mapping Major League Soccer</h3>
       	<a href="RChampineMLSmap2014.jpg"><img src="RChampineMLSmap2014.jpg" alt="MLS Map" style="width:40%;height:40%;"></a>
       	<p>I designed the "North American Soccer Experiment: A Cartographic Visualization of Major League Soccer in 2014" for the culminating project of my Advanced Cartography Course. With the guidance of my Professor, <a href=http://geography.uoregon.edu/profile/jmeacham/>James Meacham</a>, I submitted this map to National Geographic's Student mapping competition and ultimately won <a href="http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/media/student-map-awards/?ar_a=1" target="_blank">first place</a>. The design process allowed me to combine three of my most prominent obsessions: <a href="http://cascade.uoregon.edu/fall2014/social-sciences/the-beautiful-game/" target="_blank">soccer, data visualization, and cartography</a>. It was an incredible honor to receive recognition from The National Geographic Society and the Association of American Geographers as a result of my work.</p>

       	<h3>Atlas of Wildlife Migration</h3>
       	<a href="http://migrationinitiative.org/sites/migration.wygisc.org/files/public/flip/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="atlascover_screenshot.png" alt="Atlas Cover" style="width:20%;height:20%;"></a>
       	<p>During my spell at the UO InfoGraphics lab, working on the <em><a href="http://migrationinitiative.org/content/atlas-wildlife-migration" target="_blank">Atlas of Wildlife Migration</a> </em>was my primary duty. The <em>Atlas </em>is a collaboration between UO cartographers and biologists from the University of Wyoming's <a href="http://migrationinitiative.org/" target="_blank">Wildlife Migration Initiative</a>. This multi-year project tells the story of the incredible migratory patterns of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate" target="_blank">ungulates</a> in the state of Wyoming, and aims to be the exhaustive guide to these animal's journeys as well as an important asset for local conservationists.</p>
       	<p>As an assistant to the lead cartographer and production manager, I was involved in every step of the page creation process – from brainstorming on a whiteboard to copy editing a near-finished product. In a nutshell, it was my duty to bring the biologists' data of life with a combination of ArcGIS, Illustrator, and InDesign.</p>

       	<h3>Rethinking Eugene's Bike Map</h3>
       	<a href="http://eug.bike"><img src="eugbike_screenshot.png" alt="Eugene Bike Map" style="width:40%;height:40%;"></a>
       		<p>Mapmakers have spent a tremendous amount of time perfecting the symbology of automobile maps and navigational aids. For cyclists, however, techniques for displaying how to safely traverse a city's streets are inconsistent and still evolving. While cyclists may find bike lanes cased in black and the elusive bike boulevard highlighted in gold, these depictions do not reveal much about the most pressing factors that affect comfortable riding such as the amount and speed of car traffic and the slope of the street. I teamed up with a group of local bike advocates to discuss how to better address this cartographic challenge. Using data from the Lane Council of Governments and the City of Eugene, I coded a model for evaluating and symbolizing these criteria more effectively with ArcGIS and Python. The results of the model will be displayed as an <a href="http://eug.bike/" target="_blank">interactive web-map</a> using <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet </a>and <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a>.</p>
