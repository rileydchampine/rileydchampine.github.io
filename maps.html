       	<h3>Mapping Major League Soccer</h3>
       		<p>I designed the "North American Soccer Experiment: A Cartographic Visualization of Major League Soccer in 2014" for the culminating project of my Advanced Cartography Course (GEOG 495). With the guidance of my Professor, James Meacham, I submitted this map to National Geographic's Student mapping competition and ultimately won <strong><a href="http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/media/student-map-awards/?ar_a=1" target="_blank">first place</a></strong>. The design process allowed me to combine three of my most prominent obsessions: <a href="http://cascade.uoregon.edu/fall2014/social-sciences/the-beautiful-game/" target="_blank"><strong>soccer, data visualization, and cartography</strong></a>. It was an incredible honor to receive recognition from The National Geographic Society and the Association of American Geographers as a result of my work.</p>
