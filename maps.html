       	<h3>Mapping Major League Soccer</h3>
       		<p>I designed the "North American Soccer Experiment: A Cartographic Visualization of Major League Soccer in 2014" for the culminating project of my Advanced Cartography Course (GEOG 495). With the guidance of my Professor, James Meacham, I submitted this map to National Geographic's Student mapping competition and ultimately won <a href="http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/media/student-map-awards/?ar_a=1" target="_blank">first place</a>. The design process allowed me to combine three of my most prominent obsessions: <a href="http://cascade.uoregon.edu/fall2014/social-sciences/the-beautiful-game/" target="_blank">soccer, data visualization, and cartography</a>. It was an incredible honor to receive recognition from The National Geographic Society and the Association of American Geographers as a result of my work.</p>

       	<h3>[In Progress] Rethinking Eugene's Bike Map</h3>
       		<p>Mapmakers have spent a tremendous amount of time perfecting the symbology of automobile maps and navigational aids. For cyclists, however, techniques for displaying how to safely traverse a city's streets are inconsistent and still evolving. While cyclists may find bike lanes cased in black and the elusive bike boulevard highlighted in gold, these depictions do not reveal much about the most pressing factors that affect comfortable riding such as the amount and speed of car traffic and the slope of the street. I teamed up with a group of local bike advocates to discuss how to better address this cartographic challenge. Using data from the Lane Council of Governments and the City of Eugene, I coded a model for evaluating and symbolizing these criteria more effectively with ArcGIS and Python. The results of the model will be displayed as an <a href="http://eug.bike/" target="_blank">interactive web-map</a> using <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet </a>and <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a>.</p>
