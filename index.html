       	<h1>Riley D. Champine</h1>
       		<h3>Cartographer, GIS analyst, graphic designer, bassist, soccer referee, cyclist, etc.</h3>
		<p>I recently graduated from the University of Oregon with a B.S. in <a href="http://geography.uoregon.edu/">Geography </a> and a minor in <a href="https://pppm.uoregon.edu/">Planning, Public Policy &amp; Management</a>. My academic focuses were Geographic Information Science, cartography, and active transportation advocacy. Right now, I work in Silicon Valley as a GIS Tech for a big tech company.</p>
		<p>I used to be a part of the <a href=http://infographics.uoregon.edu/>UO InfoGraphics Lab</a> where I created maps and graphics for an <a href="http://migrationinitiative.org/content/atlas-wildlife-migration">atlas about ungulates in Wyoming</a></strong> and also helped maintain a geodatabase of over 80 buildings and 20,000 rooms on <a href="http://infographics.uoregon.edu/services/campus-mapping/" target="_blank">campus.</a></p>
		<p>Outside of work, I am most likely to be found on a soccer field (refereeing not playing), stubbornly fighting through Bay Area traffic by bike, or playing bass guitar.</p>
